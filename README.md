  ## Description
  It's Minesweeper for Unity! Pretty simple, made in about 2 hours with Unity 2021.3.15f1. Has a timer, customizable grid sizing/bomb count, the flag mechanic, you can even win and lose. 
  
  ## Installation
  Copy this repo into the assets folder of an empty Unity 2021.3.15f1 (other versions with Text Mesh Pro should be fine). Then naviagte to the Scenes folder and open up Main.

  ## PotentialImprovements
  Lots of room to improve. The mouse cursor position seems to be a bit more to the right than the actual mouse position for some reason. It has most minesweeper features but you aren't gauranteed not to hit a bomb on your first click, nor can you click a number to open up adjacent tiles.
